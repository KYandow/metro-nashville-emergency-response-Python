# Metro-E911-Project

Requested by Metro Nashville's Office of Emergency Management to answer these questions:

- A timeline of each storm
- Beginning and end of the event
- Times of stronger storm impacts, based on call volumes
- The geographic path of the storm generating reports of damage or impact
- Locations of heaviest storm impact based on call volume
- Locations less impacted or not impacted, based on call volume (or lack thereof)
- The types of structures impacted (Residential? Commercial?)
- Communities within the County most impacted by the storms?
- A comparison of the storm paths with areas of the community impacted by Covid today (map available at https://nashville.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=30dd8aa876164e05ad6c0a1726fc77a4)
- A correlation identifying the demographic and economic realities of each community impacted by the storm and to what severity"

Class project conducted October, 2020. The work on the main branch is solely my own. The presentation included the work of the entire Nashville Software School Data Analytics Cohort 3 class.
